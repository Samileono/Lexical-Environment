LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT: 
    Where something sits physically in the code you write.

The word lexical basically means anything related with something's syntax, grammar ( i.e the code, its vocabulary). 
basically it means where you write something and what surrounds it!

in programming language like javascript, where you write something is important. it is important because 
it tells js engine what a particular variable sits in your program and it let the programmers knows how it will interact with the other variables and functions there!

its the syntax parser that cares about where you write something so that it helps you in knowing where it will sits in computer memory!
because it will sits at the same place in the code you will write it.
